### Answer:

* During boot time when GRUB loader screen is presented press *e* key. That will open an editor with current kernel boot options.
* Find the line starting with ***linux16***. At the end of that line add **rd.break** and press ***Ctrl-x*** to restart the 
system with new option.
* ***For RHCSA8 only*** - You should also remove existing parameters **ro** and **crashkernel=...**.
* What this actually does is taking You to the target right at the end of the boot stage - before root filesystem is mounted (on /).
* Type ***mount -o remount,rw /sysroot***. This actually gets You RW access to the filesystem. ***/sysroot*** folder is Your 
normal ***/*** hierarchy.
* Type ***chroot /sysroot*** to make this folder new root directory.
* Now it is time to change the root password (that is what we are here for right?) - type ***passwd*** and provide new
password.
* In order to finish the task **SELinux** must be taken care of. If not, contents of ***/etc/shadow*** will be messed up. There are
two commands to be provided:
```
 load_policy -i 
 chcon -t shadow_t /etc/shadow
```

* Alternately, create /.autorelabel which will force a relabel on the next boot (and automatically reboot again to apply the fix):
```
touch /.autorelabel
```

* Type ***exit*** twice (with pressing ENTER after each one)
* Now You can log into the system using new password


### Additional comment:

It is possible to edit startup parameters of the kernel from the command line and make it persistent. Just edit **/etc/default/grub**
file and after that make sure to run ***grub2-mkconfig > /boot/grub2/grub.cfg*** in order to apply the changes (for old **BIOS** config). For the **UEFI** computers the final file is **/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg**.
